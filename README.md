# burger

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button and optionally a customer's name can be entered. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. If a customer name was provided, a record will be added to the Customers table and it will state who ate the burger. All the burger data is stored in a mysql db.
